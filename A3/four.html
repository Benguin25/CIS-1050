          <h1>Hockey</h1>
          <h2>
            <p>
              Hockey has been a huge part of my life. Ever since I was young, 
              I've played competitively. From house league to rep, I've enjoyed every minute of it. I played AE (which is the same as MD) for a few years
              when I was younger, before I switched to houseleague for a few years until I went off to university.
              The sport has taught me valuable lessons about teamwork, dedication, and perseverance. 
              Whether I'm on the ice or watching the game, hockey continues to be one of my greatest passions.
              Not only do I love the sport, but I love the memories even more. I still talk to and saty in touch with
              many different friends that I've made playing hockey. I also still continue to play hockey intermurals at university!

           <h1>Baseball</h1>
           <h2>
             <p>
                Apart from hockey, the only other sport I have played competitively my entire life, is baseball.
                I played select for many years of my life, until I dropped down to houseleague for the last few years
                before I went off to university. I've made countless memories playing baseball, from winning tournaments
                to making game-winning plays. The sport has taught me valuable lessons about patience, strategy, and
                staying focused under pressure. Baseball remains one of my favorite pastimes, and I still enjoy playing
                casual games with friends during the summer months. I hope to play intermurals at university next year!
