            I am currently studying for my Bachelor of Computing degree, majoring in Computer Science Honours, with a minor in Statistics at the University of Guelph. 
            I have a strong passion in Artificial Intelligence, Game Development, Embedded Systems (IoT), and Computer Vision.

              <h1>Why Computer Science?</h1>
              <h2>
                I have always been interested in Computer Science. Growing up with computers, I have always been fascinated to learn about new technologies
                and innovations, or specifically, coding. Ever since I began coding on Scratch in elementary school, I have always had a passion
                for it, and knew that I would end up in this field. Its blend of logical reasoning, creativity, and practical application makes it 
                an exciting choice for me.

              <h1>Why University of Guelph?</h1>
              <h2>
                I day that I took a tour to the University of Guelph was the day I fell in love with the campus.
                Additionally, my brother, who is two years older than me, also attends the University of Guelph for Computer Science. Maybe it runs in the family!
                Finally, the opportunity to work alongside inspiring professors and peers in a supportive environment will help me grow 
                both academically and personally as I pursue my goals in Computer Science at UOFG.
